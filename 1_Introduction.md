# Artificial Intelligence - Introduction

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

### Simple Definition

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the science of making computers and machines smart enough to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

### In Simple Terms:

AI enables machines to:
- **Learn** from experience (like humans learn from mistakes)
- **Understand** language (reading, writing, speaking)
- **Recognize** patterns (faces, objects, sounds)
- **Make decisions** (choosing the best option)
- **Solve problems** (finding solutions to complex challenges)

### Everyday Examples:
- **Siri/Alexa** - Understanding your voice commands
- **Netflix/YouTube** - Recommending videos you might like
- **Google Maps** - Finding the fastest route
- **Face Unlock** - Recognizing your face on your phone
- **Spam Filters** - Detecting unwanted emails
- **Auto-Correct** - Fixing your typing mistakes

## Four Aspects of AI Definition (Academic View)

We define AI in **4 aspects** based on two dimensions:
- **Human vs. Rational** approach
- **Thinking vs. Acting** behavior

### 1. Thinking Humanly
Systems that think like humans - <abbr title="Studying how the human brain thinks and copying it in computers">cognitive modeling</abbr> approach.
- Focuses on understanding human thought processes
- Uses cognitive science and <abbr title="Looking inside your own mind to understand how you think">introspection</abbr>
- Example: <abbr title="Computer systems designed like the human brain with connected nodes">Neural networks</abbr> inspired by human brain

### 2. Acting Humanly
Systems that act like humans - the Turing Test approach.
- Focuses on behavior that appears human
- Measured by external performance
- Example: Chatbots, virtual assistants

### 3. Thinking Rationally
Systems that think rationally - the "laws of thought" approach.
- Based on logic and formal reasoning
- Uses mathematical logic and <abbr title="Drawing conclusions from information (like solving a puzzle with clues)">inference</abbr>
- Example: <abbr title="Computer programs that solve problems like human experts do">Expert systems</abbr>, <abbr title="Programs that prove mathematical statements are true or false">theorem provers</abbr>

### 4. Acting Rationally
Systems that act rationally - the <abbr title="A system that makes the best possible decision to achieve its goal">rational agent</abbr> approach.
- Focuses on achieving the best expected outcome
- Goal-oriented behavior with optimal decision-making
- Example: <abbr title="Able to work independently without human control">Autonomous</abbr> vehicles, game-playing AI

## Summary

AI is about creating intelligent machines that can:
- Think and act like humans (human-centered approach)
- Think and act rationally (rationality-centered approach)

The field combines computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy to build systems that exhibit intelligent behavior.
